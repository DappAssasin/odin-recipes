    <h1>How to Make Potatoes Romanoff</h1>
        <p>My potatoes Romanoff is an ideal dish for big holiday gatherings since you can make it the day before and bake it when needed. Featuring shredded baked russet potatoes and sweet shallots fluffed up with sour cream and lots of Cheddar cheese, this delicious potato casserole is the perfect side dish for any cut of steak. Chef John Schenk taught me how to make this special potato gratin ten years ago at his restaurant Strip House in Las Vegas.</p>
